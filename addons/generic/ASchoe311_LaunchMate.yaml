Description: |
    Have you ever wanted to have apps or websites open and close automatically alongside your games? This is the way to do it!

    Say goodbye to manually adding launch actions or scripts for each game, because LaunchMate allows you to select an application or website to launch and then set conditions that will make it launch with any game that meets them. It's that simple!

    You can have it check games for many different aspects like title, developers, genres, categories, and more. LaunchMate also supports delaying the launch of applications if you need to ensure the game is launched first.
