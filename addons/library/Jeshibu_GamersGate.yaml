ShortDescription: Imports games from Gamersgate library.
Description: |
  This imports all the games that can be downloaded from GamersGate (DRM free as well as stuff like SecuROM).
  As a workaround for GamersGate's very restrictive CloudFlare scraping/DDOS/botting protection, the import process uses a visible browser window.
