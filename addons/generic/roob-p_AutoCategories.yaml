Description: |
    This extension automatically assigns each game to categories based on its platform or source, including short user-defined names (e.g. Sony PlayStation 2 → PS2) making it easy to keep your library organized, especially after importing new games.
    It allows you to quickly filter games across different platforms in a much more intuitive and responsive way compared to Playnite's built-in "Platform" and "Library" filters.

    Features:
    * Assign categories automatically based on each game's platform and source.
    * Define short, user-friendly names for platforms (e.g. Nintendo Entertainment System → NES) and sources (e.g. EA App → Origin).
    * If a category for a platform or source is not defined, it will be created with the platform/source name.
    * Existing categories are never deleted.
    * Games with multiple platforms will only be assigned to the first platform listed in Playnite.
    * Edit `Platforms.txt` and `Source.txt` at any time without reloading the extension.
