ShortDescription: 'A theme that aims to faithfully replicate old Steam.'
Description: | 
  "A theme I built for myself because I like an older version of the Steam layout.
  The correct aspect ratio for cover art is 171:80, that is what Steam actually rendered at by default. Playnite's preset is incorrect because it's based off of the source image instead of Steam."
