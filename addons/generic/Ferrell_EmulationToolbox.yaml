Description: Right now it can alter 3 things: 1 - Rename your PlayAction as the same as your game name. 2 - Clean your ROMs entries names so they *fit* with your PlayAction name when you have multiple ROMs. 3 - Change all hyphens ( - ) to colons (: ). The idea is to slowly add more functions that I feel are needed to organize emulated games in Playnite.
