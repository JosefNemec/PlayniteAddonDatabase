InstallerManifestUrl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeshibu/PlayniteExtensions/main/manifests/Generic_ExtraEmulatorProfiles.yaml
SourceUrl: https://github.com/Jeshibu/PlayniteExtensions
Description: |
    Adds more emulator profiles, and includes patches for profiles that need updating.
    Expect emulator profiles for arcade games, Yuzu spinoffs, etc.
    This is intended to be able to be update more frequently than Playnite itself, and thus respond to changes to emulators (and new releases) more quickly.
