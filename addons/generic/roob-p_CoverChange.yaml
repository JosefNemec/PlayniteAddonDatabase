Description: |
  * This Playnite extension lets you change game covers in a faster way.
  * Just click "Cover Change" on the context menu or choose "Batch" to select multiple images at once.
  * Select `Open metadata folder` to open game's images folder.
  * The features of this extension are already included in the more advanced CoverStyleSwitcher. However, I created this extension to provide the fastest possible way to change a game's cover.
