Description: |
    🕹️ Emulate mouse and keyboard input with your gamepad in a quick, easy and highly customizable manner.
    Perfect for old games without native controller support or with incomplete Xinput functionality.

    Features:
    * The program is very easy to use and configure: just edit the assignments in the `.ini` file and the application will be started automatically after launching the game.
    * A dedicated config can be created per game, or a global config can be used for all games.
    * Also possible to browse the config to use directly from the menu panel, or create a list of favourite configs that can be switched via sub-menu.
    * Multiple games can be selected at once. Every new config will be created.
    * The program's functionalities can be changed with a click through the menu.
    * Clear and intuitive: "LED" icons indicate the state of the program, the active config and much more.
    * The program also allows fine control over several controller aspects: deadzones (per stick, axis, or direction), axis inversion and more.
    * Config files can be edited and reloaded on-the-fly using a hotkey, without restarting the application.
    * Planned features: MACRO, COMBO and TURBO functionalities. Stay tuned.
    * ⚠️ Requires an Xinput gamepad (native or emulated via tools like DS4Windows, DualSenseX or x360ce).
