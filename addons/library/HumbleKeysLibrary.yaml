Description: |
  Humble Keys Library is a library plug-in extension for Playnite which queries Humble Bundle for third-party keys.
  The plugin allows you to search your entire collection for a game, to make sure you don't buy a new copy in the latest sale if you already have one from a previous Humble Bundle.
