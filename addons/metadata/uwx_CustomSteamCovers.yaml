ShortDescription: "Adds support for importing already configured custom Steam grid cover art to Playnite."
Description: |
  Adds support for loading Steam library grid cover art which you've already added in Steam to Playnite.
  I created this in a few minutes to load my custom Steam grid covers in Playnite.
  
  In your Playnite add-ons menu, go to Extensions settings > Metadata Sources > Custom Steam Covers, and set the path to your Steam userdata folder.

  After that, simply use Edit Game Details > Download Metadata to download with the Custom Steam Covers metadata source. You can also configure it to be used on all metadata downloads by going to Settings > Metadata.
