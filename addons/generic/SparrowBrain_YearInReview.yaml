    Year In Review generates playtime statistics reports for previous years. It is intended to be similar to Steam's Year In Review or Spotify's Wrapped.
    
    For it to work you will have to have the GameActivity addon installed and to have played with it in the previous years.
    
    The addon also comes with an ability to share your reports with your Playnite friends.
    
    Prerequisites:
    * GameActivity
    
    Warnings:
    * The addon browses the ExtensionData folder for integration with GameActivity.
